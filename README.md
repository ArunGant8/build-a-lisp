# build-a-lisp

Repository containing my version of the code in 'Build Your Own Lisp' by Daniel Holden.

## TODO:
A list of things I would like to add/improve upon:
- [ ] A better data structure for representing lisp values
- [ ] A Type System:
  - [ ] Static Type Checking
  - [ ] Type Inference, Maybe?
- [ ] MACROS
- [ ] Hashtable for looking up variables in the environment
- [ ] Garbage Collection, Maybe
